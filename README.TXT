Plot - ver. 1.0.0.

Program to plot 2D functions of single variable (cartesian,polar or parametric)

Plot is a lightweight tool, easy to use, with a simple and intuitive user interface, 
that plots mathematical functions.
The program has a built-in math expression interpreter that let the user type directly 
the function expression (eg (x+1)*sin(x/8)/cos(x) ) to plot.
It can display up to 4 functions and allows the user to pan and zoom using the mouse.
This program can be efficently used for visually solving equations and finding 
apporximate roots.
No installation required, to start the program double click on graphic_plot.exe


function types supported:
cartesian y=f(x)
polar r=r(t)
parametric x=x(t) y=t(t)
